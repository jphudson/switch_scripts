# switch_scripts
Scripts that are for use with managing switches. 

Primarily contains those that use Netmiko(https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko) and Cisco switches

I tried to keep up with sources, but there are somethings I've used for years or things that were time sensitive that I might not have sourced.  If you find something like this let me know.
